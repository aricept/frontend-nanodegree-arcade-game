###Welcome to level 1!###

Use your arrow keys to move around.

Careful!  If you touch a bug, you get pushed back to your starting position.

Oh no!  Someone appears to be trapped in the water by the bugs!  Get to them
and press an arrow in their direction, and you will get them out of the water.
You can swim, too!  Now, get them back to the other side.  Watch out!  If you
touch an enemy while carrying someone, you return to your starting position
and they return to the water!

To save your friends, you need to deposit them on the bottom row of the screen,
safely away from the bugs.  When you are on the row just above the bottom, press
the down arrow to place your friend down.

Oh no!  ANOTHER friend in trouble!  Well, better help them all...

Looks like some friends got stuck on that island over there.  Better go save them!
Be careful - the bugs have a lot more room to move around here, and there's more!
